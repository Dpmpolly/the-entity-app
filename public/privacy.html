    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>The Entity</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our fitness gamification application.</p>

    <h2>1. The Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the minimum amount of data required for the game mechanics to function. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity Information:</strong> When you sign in via Google, we collect your email address and basic profile ID to create your save file.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness Data (via Strava):</strong> We access activity data including <em>Distance</em> and <em>Start Time</em>. 
            <br><strong>Note:</strong> We DO NOT store GPS maps, heart rate data, or specific health biometrics. We only calculate total kilometers run.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> All payments are processed securely by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We do not store your credit card numbers. We may store your shipping address temporarily solely for the purpose of fulfilling merchandise orders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Important for Strava Users:</strong> The marketing term "AI" used in our game refers to "Game Logic" (deterministic algorithms), not Generative AI or Machine Learning.
    </div>
    <p>To comply with Strava API requirements and respect your privacy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> use your data to train, tune, or improve any Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) models.</li>
        <li>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> share your data with third-party AI companies (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or others).</li>
        <li>The "Entity's" behavior is determined by a mathematical formula (Moving Average) based on your past distance inputs. It does not "learn" about you personally beyond calculating a difficulty variable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use your data for the following specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Progression:</strong> To calculate the distance gap between you and the virtual "Entity."</li>
        <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> To verify your identity and restore your save file across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Order Fulfillment:</strong> To send physical rewards (such as T-shirts) to your address if earned and purchased.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely on <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Google Cloud Platform). We retain your game progress as long as your account is active.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You have the right to delete your data at any time. Inside the application Settings, click the <strong>"Burn Identity (Delete)"</strong> button. This will immediately and permanently erase your database records, unlink your Strava account, and remove your login credentials from our system.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use trusted third-party services to operate the app. Their privacy policies can be found below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strava:</strong> To sync running activities. (<a href="https://www.strava.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Strava Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For database hosting and authentication. (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> For secure payment processing. (<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
    </ul>
